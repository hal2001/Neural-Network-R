Machine_Learning
================
Inspired by Andrew Ng's machine learning class (with a HUGE thanks!), I attempt to translate his Matlab machine learning code into R solvers.
The core spirit is to warp up complicated techniques in easy-to-use functions. Current prototypes include nerual network solver, PCA compressor/expandor, K-means clustering solver and SVM optimizer.

classifier_nnet.R: A 3-layer nerual network solver for classification tasks. An example is included at the end of the script. Only two functions are intended for users, nnet_train and nnet_predict. Details to be documented.

[IN DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT USE!] abs_value_nnet.R: A 3-layer nerual network solver for absolute value prediction tasks.
